# linfo2275-hand-gesture-recognition

In order to run the notebook `hand-gesture-recognition.ipynb` you need well known datascience libraries like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn` and `scipy`. If you have Anaconda on your computer they are likely already installed.

You also need the `dollarpy` library for the $P-Recognizer algorithm. You can install it with pip.
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install dollarpy
```
