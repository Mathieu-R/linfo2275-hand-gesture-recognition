\section{Preprocessing}

We first preprocessed the data. We embedded the datas in a list of $1000$ entries. Each entry consist in a matrix of dimension (\textit{n\_timepoints}, \textit{vec\_dimensions}) where \textit{n\_timepoints} is the length of the time series and \textit{vec\_dimensions} is the dimension of the position vector which is $3$ in our case. Notice that each time series has different length, that's important for what is to follow. After that, we compressed the time series to improve the computation time of the algorithms. To do that, we performed a vector quantization by applying a k-means algorithm where each data points is replaced with its closest centroid where the number of centroids correspond to a fraction of the time series length. We decided to reduce the length by half.
