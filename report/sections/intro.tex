\section{Introduction}

We want to implement a hand gesture recognition system for a smart user interface. A 3D tracking of the position vector $\vb{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))^T$ of the hand is recorded as a sequence of the 3 coordinates in function of the time $t$\footnote{Note that we will not consider the precise recorded time of the observations.}. The user is executing a sketch that is recorded and recognized by the system.

The system will be trained in order to recognize two different kind of sketches.

A first dataset contains the records of the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ in three dimensions. We asked $10$ users to draw $10$ times each of these numbers. We have therefore a total of $1000$ sequences.

A second dataset contains the records of three-dimensional figures. As for the precedent dataset, $10$ users have drawn each figure $10$ times.
